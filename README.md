# CATMuS configuration for Beeftext

Basic and now uncomplete implementation of CATMuS keyboard for [Beeftext](https://beeftext.org/) text expander.

Basic idea:
- `:` + `character` -> combination character (currently only a couple of them)
- `_` + `character` -> superscript character (currently only a couple of them)  
- `.` + `character(s)` -> various abbreviations

 
# How to install? 
1. Download `CATMuS-beeftext.json`
2. Select: Combos -> Import and import the json file.

# Recomnended Beeftext settings
File -> Preferences -> Combos: Set `Combo triggering` to `Automatic` and check `Trigger only after spacebar is pressed`.
